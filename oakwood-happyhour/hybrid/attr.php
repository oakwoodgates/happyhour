 * HTML attribute functions and filters. The purposes of this is to provide a
 * way for theme/plugin devs to hook into the attributes for specific HTML
 * elements and create new or modify existing attributes. The biggest benefit of
 * using this is to provide richer microdata while being forward compatible with
 * the ever-changing Web.  Currently, the default microdata vocabulary supported
 * is Schema.org.
